- batch/instance rendering; prioritize instancing
- ShaderConfig object to pass into draw calls?
- optimize shader system
- move all enums to a separate file (?)
- cache texture (ktx) & store model in reuseable binary format
- check if shared_ptr in SceneManager is necessary
- Add a macro for false-asserting + glfwTerminate();
- Keep track of already used shader ids in a map with shader count, then only delete the id when shader counts
reduce to 0.
- Manage texture units (including GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP)
- LOD (mesh subdivision via geometry shader for now, mesh shader later)
- Make model loading asynchronous
- Add libraries as submodules (premake)
- create breakpoint via mingw-w64
