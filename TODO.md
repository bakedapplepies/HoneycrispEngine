- runtime vertex attribute change (GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW)
- batch/instance rendering
- push all draw calls to renderer and sort by shader
- ShaderConfig object to pass into draw calls?
- optimize shader system
- move all enums to a separate file
- cache texture (ktx) & store model in reuseable binary format
- check if shared_ptr in SceneManager is necessary
- GL_STATIC_DRAW OR GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW
- Add a macro for false-asserting + glfwTerminate();
- Keep track of already used shader ids in a map with shader count, then only delete the id when shader counts
reduce to 0.
- Model texture grouping
