- better object hierarchy abstraction
- more efficient use of VAOs and shaders and textures:
    + make bind checks
- include shader program use function in draw call?
- don't recompile library files
- runtime vertex attribute change (GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW)
- group render calls by shaders
- batch rendering
- stop reseting unique pointers for objects
- static VAO in each object type
